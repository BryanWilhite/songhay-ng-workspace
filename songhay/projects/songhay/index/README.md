# `@songhay/index` project

[This](songhay/projects/songhay/index) is the Songhay System Index App, literally an _index_ for a set of Web resources, defined by the `MenuDisplayItemModel` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-core/blob/master/src/models/menu-display-item.model.ts)]. This app supports listing and grouping index items with the `Selectable.map` [[GitHub](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-core/blob/master/src/models/selectable.ts#L25)] of the `songhay-core`. This app also supports theming.

:books: API [documentation](https://bryanwilhite.github.io/songhay-ng-workspace/index) is available.
