# Songhay Angular workspace

_Angular workspace of shared libraries and ‘studio floor’ client_

The intention here is to share Angular-based code among studio Angular projects. [The research](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/nodejs/tree/master/angular-workspace-minimal) on how to structure this workspace and projects starts in my `nodejs`, self-education repo.

## `@songhay/core` project

[These](songhay/projects/songhay/core) are the core types building on top of the more framework-agnostic `songhay-core` [repo](https://github.com/BryanWilhite/songhay-core).

## `@songhay/player-video-you-tube` project

[This](songhay/projects/songhay/player-video-you-tube) is the library for the YouTube video app of the b-roll player.
